        I think that it would be simple all they need to do is create a GIT HUB
        account then they could just manualy upload the files to a public
        repository. That should take less than 10 mins. GIT HUB will then
        automaticly generate a web page with a similar link to
        <a href="https://andrewsmc1.github.io/HTMLCodeClub/ "
          >https://andrewsmc1.github.io/HTMLCodeClub/</a
        >
        It just takes a few Mins for it to generate.

        Or you could either use the git commands or just have them install hit
        hub desktop and then upload it to a public repository, but I think that
        might be too advanced and take too much time for the WorkShop
